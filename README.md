Data Visualization using Python for AirBnb and HR Datasets
# **Data-handling-and-Visualiation-using-python**

Data visualization is important for almost every career. It can be used by teachers to display student test results, by computer scientists exploring advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) or by executives looking to share information with stakeholders. It also plays an important role in big data projects.

Data visualization allows business users to gain insight into their vast amounts of data. It benefits them to recognize new patterns and errors in the data. Making sense of these patterns helps the users pay attention to areas that indicate red flags or progress.


This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to visualize data using Python, focusing on two different datasets: the `AirBnb dataset` and the `HR dataset`.

## _Datasets_

### AirBnb dataset

The AirBnb dataset used in this repository contains information about Airbnb listings in New York City. It includes various features of the listings such as price, location, and host information.

### HR dataset

The HR dataset used in this repository contains information about employees in a company, including their gender, marital status, job title, and salary.

## _Notebook Contain_

The notebook contains Python code demonstrating how to visualize the AirBnb dataset and HR dataset using various libraries such as `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`. The notebook walks through the process of cleaning and preparing the data, and then demonstrates how to create various types of plots and visualizations such as bar plots, scatter plots, box plots, heatmaps and pie chart.

## _Requirements_
To run the notebooks, you will need to have Python 3.x installed, along with various libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 

## _Libraries used_

Libraries used in the notebooks:

- **Pandas:** for data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib:** for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations
- **Seaborn:** for creating statistical graphics

Functions demonstrated in the notebooks:

- Reading data from CSV files using Pandas.
- Cleaning and preparing data using Pandas.
- Creating different types of plots and visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn, such as bar plots, scatter plots, box plots, heatmaps and pie chart.
- Customizing plots and visualizations with various properties, such as titles, axes labels, legends, colors, and styles.
